Hexkudo is a GNOME number-placement logic game.
Each puzzle gives you a grid of hexagons and a few numbers as anchor.
Your job is to connect them into a continuous path that visits every cell exactly once, in numeric order.
Hexkudo comes with a simple interface and several difficulty levels that makes it fun for players of all skill level.

Hexkudo is inspired by several projects including [GNOME Sudoku](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-sudoku) and [Open Sudoku](https://gitlab.com/opensudoku/opensudoku)
