//! # Adding a Puzzle
//!
//! As a developer, you can add puzzles by copying and adapting this file:
//!
//! 1. Copy the file in the same directory and give the new file a name that reflects the puzzle
//!    name, difficulty, and number of cells.
//! 2. Update the file with your puzzle definition (see the comments).
//! 3. Declare your puzzle in the `src/generator/puzzles.rs` file (look for the `For developers`
//!    comments).
//! 4. Create a 128x128 SVG file for the puzzle's icon, and place it in the `data/media/icons/`
//!    directory. List the icon file in the `data/hexkudo.gresource.xml` resource file.
//! 5. Build Hexkudo.
//! 6. Generate a list of 100 fallback puzzles by using the following command:
//!
//!    ```
//!     $ flatpak run io.github.herve4m.Hexkudo -c 100 -p <puzzle_name> -f <puzzle_difficulty>
//!
//!     /// Return a tuple with the path, the diamond, and the map lists.
//!     pub fn get_random_sample_path() -> puzzles::PuzzleSampleGame {
//!         let sample_path: [[u8; 22]; 100] = [
//!             [13, 9, 10, 6, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 4, 7, 11, 8, 12, 16, 19, 21, 20, 17, 14, 15, 18],
//!             [1, 3, 0, 2, 6, 7, 4, 8, 11, 12, 16, 15, 14, 18, 19, 21, 20, 17, 13, 9, 5, 10],
//!             [14, 18, 21, 20, 17, 13, 10, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2, 0, 1, 4, 7, 11, 8, 12, 16, 19, 15],
//!             ...
//!         ];
//!         let sample_diamonds: [Vec<(u8, u8)>; 100]  = [
//!             [(11, 8), (16, 19), (7, 11), (19, 21)].to_vec(),
//!             [(8, 11), (18, 19), (17, 13)].to_vec(),
//!             [(7, 11), (8, 12), (13, 10)].to_vec(),
//!             ...
//!         ];
//!         let sample_maps: [Vec<u8>; 100] = [
//!             [18, 3, 13, 5].to_vec(),
//!             [10, 5, 3, 1].to_vec(),
//!             [14, 3, 19, 15, 0].to_vec(),
//!         ];
//!         let i:usize = rand::rng().random_range(0..sample_path.len());
//!         puzzles::PuzzleSampleGame {
//!             path: Vec::from(sample_path[i]),
//!             diamonds: sample_diamonds[i].clone(),
//!             map: sample_maps[i].clone()
//!         }
//!     }
//!     ```
//!
//!  7. Copy the command output, edit your puzzle file (this file), and replace the
//!     `get_random_sample_path()` function with the copied function.
